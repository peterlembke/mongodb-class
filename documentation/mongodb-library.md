# The MongoDb Library

The [PHP MongoDb Driver](https://www.php.net/manual/en/set.mongodb.php) is just a low level gateway to the MongoDb server. You can do everything trough the driver but it is easier with a library on top of the driver.

The [MongoDB PHP Library](https://docs.mongodb.com/php-library/v1.2/) does just that. Providing great help for you.

The library are [easily installed with composer](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mongodb.tutorial.library.php) and are added to your PHP project as any other package in the vendor folder.

If you run [Magento 2](https://magento.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) or any other major platform written in PHP then you already depend on composer and can install the MongoDb library.

But what about small projects that do not use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and do not have an active [auto loader for classes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php)?

In that case you can use this project. One class that use the MongoDb Driver.
